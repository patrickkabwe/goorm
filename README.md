# üöÄ goorm

Goorm is a QueryBuilder\ORM for Go that supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. Built with simplicity and flexibility in mind.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
go get github.com/patrickkabwe/goorm
```

> [!NOTE]
> üîÑ The Goorm ORM is yet to be implemented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> This module is still under development. Use at your own risk. The API is experimental and subject to change. This module tries to create a simple and intuitive API for interacting with databases. However, it is not a replacement for a professional database management system (DBMS) like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.

## üéØ Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"github.com/patrickkabwe/goorm"
)

type User struct {
	ID      int64    `db:"id"`
	Name    string   `db:"name"`
	Email   string   `db:"email"`
}

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open(
		string(goorm.Postgres),
		os.Getenv("POSTGRES_DSN"),
	)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}

	defer db.Close()

	qb = orm.NewQueryBuilder(db, &orm.PostgreSQL{}, nil)
	ctx := context.Background()
	email := "test@gmail.com"
	user := &User{}
	err := qb.
		InsertInto("users").
		Columns("name", "email").
		Values("patrick", email).
		Returning(ctx, user, "id", "email")

	fmt.Println(user)
